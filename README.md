# Libft
**First 42 Cursus project.**
<br>
<br>
It consists, for the most, of re-implementations of basics C libraries functions.
<br>
We find thinks like :
- string and character manipulation
- memory manipulation
- linked list helpers
- printing functions

For the most, it was not new notions. This felt like a reminder after the month of Piscine.

During the Cursus, we are allowed to add more and more useful function to it.
<br>
I added those:
- math functions
- mlx (the 42 official graphic library) helpers
- printf and get_next_line (two other 42 projects)
